# Daily Planner

This is a tool for creating general purpose printable daily planners.

## Features

These are the features that I care about in a daily planner:

- Labels for year, month, day of month, day of the week, and week of the year.
- Important days are marked. Fork this project to add in your own custom days and reoccurring todos
- 3-4 days per page with each day broken down by hours.
- Printable
- Space in the margin for 3 hole punch to store pages in a binder

## Anti-Features

These are features that are common in mass-produced daily planners that I am intentionally avoiding:

- Blank "notes" pages or sections. These are filler pages and don't belong in a planner. The only notes you should be writing in a planner are what you are doing on a given day. It is a scheduling tool with pages that you can throw away or archive as soon as you're done with the week. Record observations & reflections elsewhere.
- Non-reusable spiral binding. Most daily planners that you buy from the store cannot be refilled with new pages. They are designed to be thrown away at the end of the year. This planner is designed to be put in a reusable/refillable 3-ring binder.

## Local Development

To start the Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
